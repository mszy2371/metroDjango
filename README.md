# metroDjango

The purpose of the program is to create a personalised rota for night shift drivers and lets them check their colleagues rotas or specified dates to find a person who is off duty and would be able to swap on the desire date. I originally created this project in Flask and then decided to re-create it in Django, split the project for few independent apps, improve UX and optimize it for mobile users. The project is still live at: https://marcinek.pythonanywhere.com/.
There is also a docker image to pull from DockerHub: mszy2371/metrodjango-app:latest. Since there are no sensitive data stored in the app the full functionality might be checked with test credentials - Name: test_user Password: test_password. All the yellow digits/words are links.
