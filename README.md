# metroDjango

The purpose of the program is to create a personalised rota for night shift drivers and lets them check their colleagues rotas or specified dates to find a person who is off duty and would be able to swap on the desire date. I originally created this project in Flask and then decided to re-create it in Django, split the project for few independent apps, improve UX and optimize it for mobile users. The project is still live at: https://marcinek.pythonanywhere.com/
